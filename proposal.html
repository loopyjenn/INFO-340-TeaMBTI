            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                In modern workplaces and school environments, effective communication and collaboration are essential for reaching goals. However, people may often face challenges regarding conflicting work styles, different learning backgrounds, and communication barriers. In order to foster a productive working environment, it is necessary to understand each individual’s unique personality and behaviors. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test is worldly renowned for being a “personality quiz” that people can take to understand more about themselves, however, it can be an effective tool when applied to group environments. According to <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-2795583#:~:text=What%20these%20people%20are%20referring,type%2C%20strengths%2C%20and%20preferences.">verywellmind</a>, the MBTI test categorizes individuals into different types in four key areas: introversion (“I”) vs. extraversion (“E”), sensing (“S”) vs. intuition (“N”), thinking (“T”) vs. feeling (“F”), and judging (“J”) vs. perceiving (“P”).

                There has already been debate about the advantages and disadvantages that can be presented in utilizing the MBTI test for team-building.
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-advantages-disadvantages-using-myers-briggs-type">LinkedIn</a> points out that there are benefits
                to understanding one’s MBTI along with a teammate’s, such as being able to identify and pinpoint areas of conflict and misunderstanding and resolve them accordingly.
                However, they also point out that MBTIs can be oversimplified at times, with people believing that it is a definitive measure of one’s personality.
                We will try to avoid this preconception by providing nuance to personality types through features such as compatibility tests, which will avoid making them appear as just a label.

            <p>Existing apps that are insufficient:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heads Up: there is a lack of personal information from the user however it’s great to use as an icebreaker</li>
                <li>Canvas: strictly academic-related, can be hard for users to bond due to the academic nature of the app</li>
                <li>SmartSheet/Jira: more widely used in the workplace and project management</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>Currently, there is a stigma around group projects and or working with a team. The dread of using overdone icebreakers not only bores individuals but also leaves very little room for people to effectively interact with and get to know each other. Using MBTI as a metric, we plan to assist users through our app to cultivate new relations and drive productivity in a variety of settings (school, work, etc.) Users will be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take the <em>MBTI test</em> if they do not already know it (link to the official MBTI test site)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can compare their MBTI type with other team members in a <em>compatibility assessment</em> to identify how their personalities mesh or pinpoint areas of conflict.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Member invitations:</em> Team/group leaders have the ability to invite members to a team via email or invitation link. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>In-depth recommendations/feedback:</em> Team leaders can view the overall variety of personality types within the team, and generate analyses of the team dynamic based on the personality types. For example, if there is a balance between introverts (“I”) and extroverts (“E”) within the team, the website might suggest switching between extroverted activities such as collaborative brainstorming, and introverted activities such as individual reflections. These recommendations would be updated in real-time as new members are added or personality types are updated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Our target audience of users will include team leaders and managers who are responsible for overseeing collaboration and productivity within their teams, as well as team members who hope to better understand their working behaviors along with their teammates, in order to enhance communication and teamwork. The information that the user will be viewing will be acquired from the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">official MBTI website</a>, through the quiz, as well as other functionalities within the app such as the compatibility assessment. We do not intend to use data from an external source for our app, since we don’t aim to have the test integrated within the app; instead, when prompted, the user will be able to take the test on the official website. We project that this app will help solve our problem by providing opportunities for in-depth understanding of how teammates’ personalities can synergize when working together, as well as to dispel problems of conflict between team members in group settings.
